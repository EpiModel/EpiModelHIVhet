# EpiModelHIVhet

EpiModelHIVhet provides extension modules to the [EpiModel](http://epimodel.org) software package to simulate network-based epidemics of HIV, with a focus on transmission dynamics among heterosexual couples in Sub-Saharan Africa. 

As of 06/24/2016, we have merged this package into a more broader `EpiModelHIV` package that includes our simulation coding for both heterosexual and men who have sex with men (MSM) populations. That software may be accessed at http://github.com/statnet/EpiModelHIV. As a result, no further development of the heterosexual model code will occur in this repository as of the date above.
